## General Assembly Data Science Final Project by Ian Myjer

This is Ian Myjer's final project for the part-time data science course offered by General Assembly in Washington DC  

The purpose of this project was to use the [AMPds dataset](http://ampds.org/) to practice data science processes and skills learned in class. The specific modelling purpose was energy usage disaggregation, similar to this [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/belkin-energy-disaggregation-competition). 

Goals for the project were:
  - Properly prepare and clean the dataset
  - Effectively visualize the dataset
  - Learn to properly build models
  - Learn which model to apply to a particular problem
  - Learn to evaluate models based on an appropriate evaulation metric
  - Learn to improve models using feature engineering

Project status:
  - The final project was presented on March 27th - the presentation can be found in the repository
  - Work on this project is ongoing but is expected to be sporadic. First priority improvements are code structure and modelling process.
